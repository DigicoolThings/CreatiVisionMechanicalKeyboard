# CreatiVision Mechanical Keyboard

The CreatiVision was a colour TV Gaming Console and Personal Computer from the early 1980's. It was based on the popular 8-bit 6502 CPU, the TMS9929A/28A Video Display Processor, and the SN76489 Digital Complex Sound Generator chip.

As part of my 8-bit retro computing Minimalist Europe Card Bus (MECB) project, I configured some of the MECB Cards to enable the re-Creation of the CreatiVision system hardware.

I then designed a Controller Interface (see separate CreatiVisionController repository), to enable connecting a PS/2 Keyboard and Atari Joysticks to control my CreatiVision re-Creation.

My CreatiVision Controller interface project turned into a dual purpose design, as the Controller can also be used to upgrade an existing original CreatiVision Console, to allow using a more modern Keyboard and Joysticks (in addition to use with CreatiVision re-Creations!).

The CreatiVision Mechanical Keyboard featured here is a PS/2 interfaced mechanical Keyboard, designed to be an add-on to the CreatiVision Controller interface. Providing a CreatiVision specific 48-key Mechanical Keyboard which matches both the key layout and key legends of the original CreatiVision moving key keyboard accessory.

For more information about this project, including the MECB based CreatiVision re-Creation, my design journey creating the CreatiVision Controller interface and this CreatiVision Keyboard, and a demonstration of use on both an original CreatiVision Console and my MECB CreatiVision re-Creation, be sure to watch my CreatiVision re-Creation playlist series of YouTube Videos.


This project is available as either the PCB only, or with optional Packs (to make a Kitset), from my [Tindie Store](https://www.tindie.com/stores/digicoolthings/).
