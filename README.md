# CreatiVision Mechanical Keyboard

The CreatiVision was a colour TV Gaming Console and Personal Computer from the early 1980's. It was based on the popular 8-bit 6502 CPU, the TMS9929A/28A Video Display Processor, and the SN76489 Digital Complex Sound Generator chip.

As part of my 8-bit retro computing Minimalist Europe Card Bus (MECB) project, I configured some of the MECB Cards to enable the re-Creation of the CreatiVision system hardware.

I then designed a Controller Interface (see separate CreatiVisionController repository), to enable connecting a PS/2 Keyboard and Atari Joysticks to control my CreatiVision re-Creation.

My CreatiVision Controller interface project turned into a dual purpose design, as the Controller can also be used to upgrade an existing original CreatiVision Console, allowing the use of a more modern Keyboard and Joysticks (in addition to use with CreatiVision re-Creations!).

The CreatiVision Mechanical Keyboard featured here is a PS/2 interfaced Mechanical Keyboard, designed to be an add-on to the CreatiVision Controller interface. Providing a CreatiVision specific 48-key Mechanical Keyboard which matches both the key layout and key legends of the original CreatiVision moving key keyboard accessory.

For more information about this project, including the MECB based CreatiVision re-Creation, my design journey creating the CreatiVision Controller interface and this CreatiVision Keyboard, and also a demonstration of use on both an original CreatiVision Console and my MECB CreatiVision re-Creation, be sure to watch my CreatiVision re-Creation playlist series of YouTube Videos.

The latest iteration of this CreatiVision Mechanical Keyboard project is v3, which introduces full bidirectional PS/2 protocol compatibility, allowing this compact Mechanical 48-key Keyboard to be used with other PS/2 Hosts, not just the CreatiVision Controller (as was originally intended). Full details can be found via the (Part 5) YouTube Video and associated Blog, linked below.


This project is available as either the PCB only, or with optional Packs (to make a full Kitset), from my [Tindie Store](https://www.tindie.com/stores/digicoolthings/).
